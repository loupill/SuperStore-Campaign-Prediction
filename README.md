This repository contains the SuperStore Campaign Prediction project, which focuses on predicting the success of marketing campaigns for a retail SuperStore. The project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a predictive model.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the outcome of marketing campaigns run by the SuperStore. By analyzing various customer and campaign-related features, we aim to determine the likelihood of a campaign being successful in terms of generating sales or customer engagement.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named "SuperStore KNN.ipynb". It includes detailed explanations, code snippets, visualizations, and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the model's performance.

Key Features
Data Exploration: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided dataset to understand the characteristics and relationships between different variables. This step involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.

Feature Engineering: We engineer relevant features from the available dataset to enhance the predictive power of our model. This may involve creating new variables, transforming existing ones, and handling missing values.

Model Development: We utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build the predictive model. The notebook provides explanation of the algorithm, its implementation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of our model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps us assess the effectiveness of our campaign prediction model.
